## Assume the home directory is ‘/home/user’. The below diagram shows the file structure of the ‘ops102’ directory which is located in the user directory.

#### 1.	You are currently in the ‘Functions’ directory, write the relative path to go the ‘relative.txt’ file.
#### 2.	You are currently in the ‘Functions’ directory, write the absolute path to go the ‘absolute.txt’ file.
#### 3.	You are currently in the ‘Functions’ directory, write the relative-to-home path to go the ‘relative-to-home.txt’ file.

## Assume the home is ‘/home/sem1’ and the given tree shows the file structure of the sem1 directory.

### Answer the questions based on the above diagram. For each question, write the Absolute, Relative and Relative to Home path.
#### 1.	Assume you are in the ‘ops102’ directory, how you can go to the ‘userInterface’ directory?
#### 2.	Assume you are in the ‘userInterface’ directory, how you can go to the ‘fileSystems’ directory?
#### 3.	Assume you are in the ‘ops102’ directory, write a command to copy the file ‘absolute.txt’ to the ‘components’ directory?
#### 4.	Assume you are in the ‘userInterface’ directory, write a command to copy the file ‘CLI.txt’ to the ‘functions’ directory?

#### For Discussion in next class :
#### Create a similar tree like structure as shown in the diagram.
