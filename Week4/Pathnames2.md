### Answer the questions based on the above diagram. For each question, write the Absolute, Relative and Relative to Home path.

  1. Assume you are in the ‘ops102’ directory, how you can go to the ‘userInterface’ directory?
  2. Assume you are in the ‘userInterface’ directory, how you can go to the ‘fileSystems’ directory?
  3. Assume you are in the ‘ops102’ directory, write a command to copy the file ‘absolute.txt’ to the ‘components’ directory?
  4. Assume you are in the ‘userInterface’ directory, write a command to copy the file ‘CLI.txt’ to the ‘functions’ directory?

  
 ### For Discussion in next class :

Create a similar tree like structure as shown in the diagram.
