Q1. Write a script "area.bash" which will calculate the area. The user will input the name of the shape and its dimension through arguments but for now, your script will only be able to calculate the area of the rectangle.
to run the script I will write:

./area.bash rectangle 3 $

it will output

The area of the rectangle is: 12

if I run the script without an argument like this 
./area.bash
it will say 
"I only know how to calculate the area of a rectangle"

some more test cases below and their following output:

./area.bash circle
"I only know how to calculate the area of a rectangle"

./area.bash rectangle
"Invalid number of arguments"

./area.bash rectangle 2
"Invalid number of arguments"

./area.bash rectangle 0 
"Arguments are invalid"

./area.bash rectangle 1 0
"Arguments are invalid"


Answer:

#!/bin/bash

#echo $#
#echo $*
#echo $@
#echo $2

if [[ $1 != "rectangle" ]]
then
        echo "I only know how to calculate the area o$
else
        if [[ $# -ne 3 ]]
        then
                echo "Invalid number of arguments"
        elif [[ $2 -le 0 || $3 -le 0  ]]
        then
                echo "Argument are Invalid"
        else
                area=$(($2*$3))
                echo "The area of rectangle is : $are$
        fi
fi

Mistake
-------------------------------------------------------

1. used != or other comparison operator with number
2. Forgot to do the validation as mentioned in question
3. Didn't Understood the question
4. area=$((2*3)) -> forgot to put $ sign in front of 2 and 3
5. Didn't covered all the cases
6. 

Correction
-----------------------------
1. Should use -ne with numbers
2. Read question carefully and completely
3. Read carefully multiple time or ask again.
4. area=$(($2*$3))  
5. Read question carefully and completely
